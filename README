Stamk:
Stamk (short for static make) is a python based C and C++ build system designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
It's primary goal is to make it easy to build standalone static applications which depend only upon the kernel of their respective operating system.

Linux:
On Linux Stamk builds depend only on the linux kernel itself and use syscalls to communicate with the OS.
Linux builds are created using the musl compiler and musl standard library.
This is because statically linking the standard library from gcc is considered unsafe and musl is specifically designed for this purpose.

Windows:
On Windows Stamk builds depend only on ntdll.dll, KERNEL32.dll, and KERNELBASE.dll.
Windows builds are created using the UCRT library (Microsoft Universal C Runtime).
So why all those DLLs in my static build?
ntdll.dll is injected by the Windows kernel at load time and even removing it from your exe's import table doesn't prevent this.
As for KERNEL32.dll and KERNELBASE.dll these are technically optional but removing them means calling undocumented API's in ntdll.dll.
These function signatures change frequently without warning and ntdll.dll has no documentation making it incredibly painful to develop an app this way.

Mac:
Mac builds are currently unsupported for the very simple reason that I am too poor to afford a Mac at this time.
If anyone would like to gift me a MacBook that would be epic LOL :)
